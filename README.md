# Cover-letter-Generator


The Cover Letter Generator is a project that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 model to automatically generate cover letters based on basic job details
provided by the user. It aims to simplify and expedite the process of creating customized cover letters for job applications.


**How it Works** :- 

1. User Input: The user provides basic job details such as the job title, company name, and any specific requirements or qualifications for the position. 
               These details are used to personalize the generated cover letter.

2. OpenAI GPT-3 Model: The project employs OpenAI's powerful GPT-3 language model, trained on a wide range of texts, to generate coherent and
                       contextually relevant cover letters. The model leverages its understanding of language and context to create persuasive and engaging letters.

3. Text Generation: The input provided by the user is combined with predefined cover letter templates to guide the generation process. 
                    The GPT-3 model takes this information as input and generates a complete cover letter that is tailored to the specified job details.

4. Output: Once the cover letter is generated, it is displayed to the user, who can then review and make any necessary modifications before finalizing it.


**Setup and Dependencies** :- 

To run the Cover Letter Generator project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
1. Python 3.x
2. OpenAI Python package

You can install the OpenAI package by running the following command
--> pip install openai

Additionally, you will need an OpenAI API key to access the GPT-3 model. Obtain an API key by visiting the OpenAI website and following the instructions.


**Usage** :- 

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Setup and Dependencies" section.

3. Create an environment variable 'OPENAI_API_KEY' assign it your actual OpenAI API key.

4. Run the application by executing the following command:
--> streamlit run cover_letter.py

5. Follow the prompts displayed in the terminal to provide the necessary job details, such as the job title, company name, and specific requirements.

6. Once the cover letter is generated, it will be displayed in the terminal. Review the letter and make any desired modifications.

7. Copy the generated cover letter to your preferred text editor or word processor for further formatting and customization.
   or if you think the cover letter generated is good enough then you can download the cover letter in pdf format using the download button.
